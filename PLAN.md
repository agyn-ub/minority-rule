# Minority Rule Game - Flow Blockchain Implementation

## Project Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED & TESTED

## Game Overview

The Minority Rule Game is a psychological strategy game inspired by the Liar Game series, implemented as a decentralized application (dApp) on the Flow blockchain. Players stake FLOW tokens to enter, vote on binary questions, and those who vote with the minority survive each round. The last remaining player(s) win the entire prize pool.

## Core Game Mechanics

### 1. Game Structure

#### Game States (Implemented)
```cadence
access(all) enum GameState: UInt8 {
    access(all) case created       // Initial state (brief)
    access(all) case active        // Transition state
    access(all) case votingOpen    // Accepting votes for current round
    access(all) case processingRound // Processing votes and eliminations
    access(all) case complete      // Game ended, winner(s) determined
}
```

#### Game Lifecycle
1. **Game Creation**: Creator pays entry fee, game starts immediately in Round 1
2. **Round 1 - Open Registration**: Players can join while voting is open
3. **Voting Phase**: Players submit votes privately (stored on-chain but hidden)
4. **Processing Phase**: Votes revealed, minority calculated, players eliminated
5. **Next Round or End**: Continue if ≥3 players remain, otherwise game ends
6. **Prize Claim**: Winner(s) claim their share of the pool

#### Entry and Stakes
- **Entry Fee**: Configurable (e.g., 10 FLOW)
- **Prize Pool**: Sum of all player stakes
- **Winner Distribution**:
  - 1 winner: Takes entire pool
  - 2 winners: Split equally
  - 0 winners: Pool remains unclaimed

### 2. Voting Mechanism (Implemented)

#### Simple Private Voting
- **Voting Duration**: Configurable (default 1800 seconds/30 minutes)
- **Vote Storage**: Private until round processing
- **Vote Options**: Binary YES (true) or NO (false)
- **Question**: Set by game creator (e.g., "Will the majority vote YES?")

#### Vote Processing
```cadence
// Votes stored privately during round
access(contract) var currentVotes: {Address: Bool}
access(contract) var hasVoted: {Address: Bool}

// Revealed after deadline in processRound()
```

### 3. Elimination Rules (Implemented)

#### Minority Calculation
1. Count YES votes and NO votes
2. Determine minority (fewer votes)
3. Special cases:
   - **Tie**: All voters survive
   - **Unanimous**: Round dismissed, all survive
   - **Non-voters**: Automatically eliminated

#### Game Ending Conditions
- Game ends when fewer than 3 players remain active
- Can result in 0, 1, or 2 winners
- Winners split prize pool equally

### 4. Player Profiles & Statistics (Implemented)

```cadence
access(all) struct PlayerProfile {
    access(all) let address: Address
    access(all) var gamesPlayed: UInt32
    access(all) var gamesWon: UInt32
    access(all) var totalStaked: UFix64
    access(all) var totalWinnings: UFix64
    access(all) var roundsSurvived: UInt32
    access(all) var totalRounds: UInt32
}
```

## Technical Architecture (Implemented)

    creator: Address,
    entryFee: UFix64,
    roundDuration: UFix64,
    questionText: String,
    payment: @{FungibleToken.Vault}

// Submit vote for current round
access(all) fun submitVote(player: Address, vote: Bool)

// Process round and determine eliminations
access(all) fun processRound()
