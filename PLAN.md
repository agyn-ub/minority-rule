# Minority Rule Game - Flow Blockchain Implementation Plan

## Game Overview

The Minority Rule Game is a psychological strategy game inspired by the Liar Game series, implemented as a decentralized application (dApp) on the Flow blockchain. Players stake FLOW tokens to enter, vote on binary questions, and those who vote with the minority survive each round. The last remaining player wins the entire prize pool.

## Core Game Mechanics

### 1. Game Structure

#### Game Phases
1. **Registration Phase**: Players join by staking FLOW tokens
2. **Game Active**: Multiple voting rounds until one winner remains
3. **Round Phases**:
   - Voting Phase: Players submit their votes privately
   - Results Phase: All votes revealed simultaneously after deadline
   - Processing: Minority calculation and player elimination
4. **Game Complete**: Winner claims entire prize pool

#### Entry and Stakes
- **Entry Fee**: Configurable minimum FLOW stake (e.g., 10 FLOW)
- **Prize Pool**: Sum of all player stakes
- **Winner Takes All**: Single winner receives entire pool
- **No Partial Refunds**: Eliminated players lose their entire stake

### 2. Voting Mechanism

#### Simple Private Voting
To enable strategic gameplay while maintaining simplicity:

**Voting Phase (24 hours)**
- Players submit their vote privately (stored on-chain but hidden)
- Public discussions/announcements allowed (enabling deception and strategy)
- Cannot see others' votes until round ends
- Vote stored encrypted or access-controlled until reveal

**Results Reveal (Automatic)**
- When voting deadline passes, all votes revealed simultaneously
- Non-voting players automatically eliminated
- Results calculated and minority determined instantly

#### Vote Options
- Binary choice: YES (true) or NO (false)
- Questions can be arbitrary (set by game creator)
- Examples: "Will the majority vote YES?", "Is cooperation better than betrayal?"

### 3. Elimination Rules

#### Minority Calculation
After voting deadline:
1. Count total YES votes and NO votes
2. Determine minority: choice with fewer votes
3. If tied (equal votes), both groups survive
4. Players who voted with majority are eliminated

#### Special Cases
- **Single Survivor**: Game ends, player wins entire pool
- **No Survivors**: If all players fail to reveal, pool locked (or returned)
- **Two Players Tie**: Both win, split pool equally

### 4. Player History & Reputation System

#### Player Statistics (On-Chain & Public)
```
PlayerProfile {
    address: Address
    gamesPlayed: UInt32
    gamesWon: UInt32
    totalStaked: UFix64
    totalWinnings: UFix64
    roundsSurvived: UInt32
    votingHistory: [VoteRecord]  // Fully public after each round
}

VoteRecord {
    gameId: UInt64
    round: UInt32
    actualVote: Bool       // What they actually voted
    wasMinority: Bool      // Whether they survived
    playersEliminated: UInt32  // How many were eliminated that round
}
```

#### Public History Features
- **Full Transparency**: All past votes visible to all players
- **Pattern Analysis**: Players can study opponents' voting patterns
- **Survival Rate**: Average rounds survived per game
- **Voting Tendencies**: YES/NO preference percentages
- **Minority Success Rate**: How often player votes with minority

### 5. Game Theory Elements

#### Strategic Considerations
1. **Historical Analysis**: Study opponents' past voting patterns
2. **Psychological Warfare**: Public discussions before voting deadline
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify predictable players
4. **Prisoner's Dilemma**: Cooperation vs. individual gain
5. **Meta-Gaming**: Adapt strategy based on remaining players' histories

#### Optimal Strategies
- **Level 1**: Vote randomly (50% survival chance)
- **Level 2**: Vote opposite of public consensus
- **Level 3**: Analyze player reputations and tendencies
- **Level 4**: Deliberate reputation building/destruction
- **Level 5**: Coalition forming and betrayal

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Smart Contract Structure

#### Main Contract: `MinorityRuleGame.cdc`
```cadence
access(all) contract MinorityRuleGame {
    // Game Management
    access(all) resource Game {
        access(all) let gameId: UInt64
        access(all) let entryFee: UFix64
        access(all) var state: GameState
        access(all) var currentRound: UInt32
        access(all) let players: {Address: Player}
        access(all) let prizePool: @FlowToken.Vault
        access(contract) var currentVotes: {Address: Bool}  // Hidden until reveal
        access(all) var roundHistory: [RoundResult]  // Public after each round
    }

    // Player Management
    access(all) struct Player {
        access(all) let address: Address
        access(all) let joinedAt: UFix64
        access(all) var isActive: Bool
        access(all) var eliminatedRound: UInt32?
        access(all) var votingHistory: [Bool]  // Public record of all votes
    }

    // Round Results (Public)
    access(all) struct RoundResult {
        access(all) let round: UInt32
        access(all) let votes: {Address: Bool}  // All votes public after round
        access(all) let minorityChoice: Bool
        access(all) let eliminatedPlayers: [Address]
        access(all) let timestamp: UFix64
    }
}
```

access(all) event GameComplete(gameId: UInt64, winner: Address, prize: UFix64)
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Attack Vectors and Mitigations

#### Vote Manipulation Prevention
- **Problem**: Last-second vote changes based on others' votes
- **Solution**: All votes hidden until deadline, then revealed simultaneously

#### Collusion Attacks
- **Problem**: Players forming coalitions to coordinate votes
- **Solution**:
  - Reputation system exposes consistent patterns
  - Random round timing variations
  - Optional hidden player count modes

#### Sybil Attacks
- **Problem**: One entity controlling multiple accounts
- **Solution**:
  - Entry fee makes this expensive
  - Reputation system tracks account age/history
  - Optional KYC for high-stake games

### 2. Smart Contract Security

#### Access Control
- Only game creator can start/process rounds
- Players can only interact with their own votes
- Prize withdrawal only by verified winner

#### Reentrancy Protection
- Check-effects-interactions pattern
- Vault operations atomic
- State updates before external calls

#### Time Manipulation
- Use block timestamps for phases
- Minimum phase durations enforced
- Grace periods for network delays

## Economic Model

### 1. Tokenomics

#### Staking Mechanism
- Minimum stake: 1 FLOW
- Maximum stake: Optional cap per game
- No partial withdrawals during game
- Stakes locked until elimination/victory

#### Fee Structure
- Platform fee: 2% of prize pool
- Gas fees: Paid by transaction sender
- Emergency withdraw penalty: 10%

### 2. Incentive Alignment

#### Player Incentives
- **Win Maximization**: Entire pool as prize
- **Reputation Building**: Better future game access
- **Strategic Depth**: Multiple winning strategies

#### Platform Sustainability
- Platform fees fund development
- Tournament modes with sponsored prizes
- Premium features (private games, analytics)
